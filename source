A selectable is a kind of thing. A selectable is usually scenery.

Defender is a selectable in the Battle Maker.
Attacker is a selectable in the Battle Maker.

Terrain 1 is a selectable in the Battle Maker. The description of terrain 1 is "[land list]".
Terrain 2 is a selectable in the Battle Maker. The description of terrain 2 is "[land list]".

To say land list:
	repeat through the table of terrain:
		say "[link][terrain entry] - [evasion entry]EVA/[DR entry]DR[as]terrain [terrain entry][end link][line break]".

A selectable is either salient or not salient. A selectable is usually not salient.

Before examining a selectable:
	now every selectable is not salient;
	now the noun is salient.
	
The description of a selectable is usually "Choose your [the noun]:

[party]".

Check going north from the battle maker:
	reset all the stats.

Part - 5 Proficiency Codes

Increasing rank is an action applying to one topic. Understand "rank up [text]" as increasing rank.

Carry out increasing rank:
	let T be the topic understood in title case;
	choose the row with a category of T in the table of ranks;
	let C be the code entry;
	choose a row with a name of current name in the table of characters;

	else:
		say "You can't increase that rank any further." instead;
	now current rank code is Z;
	now the rank code entry is current rank code;
	try looking.

The current rank code is a text that varies. The current rank code is "No ranks".

To say rank listing:
	repeat through the table of ranks:
		let X be the code entry;
		let rank be character number X in the current rank code;
		if rank is not "F":
			say "[Category entry]: [rank]|".
